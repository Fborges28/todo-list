// Welcome to Cypress!
//
// This spec file contains a variety of sample tests
// for a todo list app that are designed to demonstrate
// the power of writing tests in Cypress.
//
// To learn more about how Cypress works and
// what makes it such an awesome testing tool,
// please read our getting started guide:

  it("can add new todo items", () => {
    // We'll store our item text in a variable so we can reuse it
    const newItem = "Nova tarefa";

    // Let's get the input element and use the `type` command to
    // input our new list item. After typing the content of our item,
    // we need to type the enter key as well in order to submit the input.
    // This input has a data-test attribute so we'll use that to select the
    // element in accordance with best practices:
    // https://on.cypress.io/selecting-elements
    cy.get("#todo").type(`${newItem}{enter}`);

    // Now that we've typed our new item, let's check that it actually was added to the list.
    // Since it's the newest item, it should exist as the last element in the list.
    // In addition, with the two default items, we should have a total of 3 elements in the list.
    // Since assertions yield the element that was asserted on,
    // we can chain both of these assertions together into a single statement.
